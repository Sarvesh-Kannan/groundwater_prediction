This consists of the various models that have been used for Ground water level prediction and their significances:

Artificial Neural Networks have been adopted by many researchers for ground water prediction, but the drawback of it is that the model can be easily overfitted 

SVM was also used for groundwater prediction in a later period of time 

Genetic Programming was also used by some for predicting the ground water levels 

ELM's were also used and they are mainly known for their easier training speeds and they are mainly known since they are easier to train since they oonly contain a single hidden layer
